#### Project Introduction

**UniScope** is an integrated platform that provides comprehensive information about lectures, professors, and universities across South Korea. It's a service that helps students make informed decisions about course selection and university comparison based on real student reviews.

UniScope provides essential information for every moment of university life - from college students considering credit exchange programs, to those planning graduate school, and even high school students preparing for university admission. It's a comprehensive university information platform that helps everyone make better choices.

Internationally, platforms like RateMyProfessor have been actively operating, where students directly evaluate and share information about lectures and professors. However, in South Korea, such integrated platforms don't exist, and information remains fragmented.

UniScope was created to fill that gap, helping students make more objective and better-informed decisions.
