#### Project Introduction

**UniScope** is an integrated platform that provides comprehensive information about lectures, professors, and universities across South Korea. It's a service that helps students make informed decisions about course selection and university comparison based on real student reviews.

UniScope provides essential information for every moment of university life - from college students considering credit exchange programs, to those planning graduate school, and even high school students preparing for university admission. It's a comprehensive university information platform that helps everyone make better choices.

Internationally, platforms like RateMyProfessor have been actively operating, where students directly evaluate and share information about lectures and professors. However, in South Korea, such integrated platforms don't exist, and information remains fragmented.

UniScope was created to fill that gap, helping students make more objective and better-informed decisions.

#### Project Details

- **Developed UniScope**, an integrated platform providing comprehensive national university information using **TypeScript** and **React**
- **Documented all project UI components** using **Storybook**, increasing code reusability and ensuring design consistency across the application
- **Established an E2E testing environment** using **Playwright** to automate critical UI flows and major business logic within a real browser context
- **Optimized page structure and performance** to achieve high scores on all four Lighthouse metrics, enhancing initial accessibility through Meta Tag-based SEO
